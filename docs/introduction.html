    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The objective of this animation is to provide an interactive experience for students learning thermodynamic processes. Its main component is a gas contained inside a cylinder that can be expanded, compressed, heated, and cooled. Aditionally, sensors of pressure, temperature and volume are visible all the time.</p>
    <p>With the intention of boosting interactivity, a real time plot of the P-V diagram can be viewed. This gives the student the possibility of playing the game of drawing an specific P-V diagram simply by using the heat and volume controls of the animation.</p>
